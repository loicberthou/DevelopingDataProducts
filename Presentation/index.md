## Introduction

- This Shiny application is inspired by the final project of the Regression Modeling class.
- The data is taken from the **mtcars** dataset in the package **datasets**.
- The objective is to demonstrate the choice of model for the MPG.

## The models

### Model 1: lm(mpg ~ wt + factor(am), data=mtcars)
Selecting the two most influential factors.

### Model 2: lm(mpg ~ wt * factor(am), data=mtcars)
Selecting the two most influential factors with their concurrent interraction.

### Model 3: lm(mpg ~ wt * factor(am) + qsec, data=mtcars)
Adding the qsec factor.
